Scripts for creating docking results figures with python.

# Original script developed by Dr.  Tâp Ha-Duong 
# Adapted and modified by Sara Shahriari for Smoothened receptor and its ligands interaction analysis
# Modifications include: input handling, figure formatting, data selection

The Python script in the `figures/` folder was originally developed by Dr. Tâp Ha-Duong (the supervisor of my computational projects) and used in a published study. I adapted and modified it for my own research projects, including data processing and figure generation.
