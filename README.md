# Molecular-Docking-and-Analysis
Scripts used for docking automation and data visualization in research projects.
This repository contains Bash and Python scripts developed and adapted during my
research projects for molecular docking and data analysis.

## Structure
- `docking_scripts/`: Bash scripts to automate AutoDock Vina docking runs
- `analysis_scripts/`: Scripts to extract docking scores and compute statistics
- `figures/`: Python script adapted for data visualization

## Tools
- Bash
- Python (matplotlib)
- AutoDock Vina

These scripts demonstrate experience with workflow automation, data analysis
and reproducible computational research.
